# Splatoon Discord Bot


## Disclamer

Nintendo does not own this Discord bot, and it is made to bring the Splatoon franchise to Discord.

- [Discord](https://discord.com/)
- [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/)

This bot is **not** public and has no plans of doing so, however, you may fork this, or download and create your own bot using this code. Do note that this is not made with the intent for it to be easy for you to make your bot, it is just simply the source code available.
