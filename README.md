## About
This discord bot adds many features from the Splatoon Franchise by Nintendo into Discord, the most notable being Salmon, where you will Splat salmonoids, collect Power Eggs, and compete against friends.

This bot is currently not Public and does not have any plans of being public. This is because this is meant for a couple of personal servers. I do not have the resources to make this bot Public.

This bot is also not in a complete state, and there will likely be bugs, I will do my best to fix them, but it will take a while. All of the Releases should be mostly stable. 

This bot is being developed solely by [TheSquiddyLink](https://github.com/TheSquiddyLink), who is a Full-Time Student and Part-time Employee meaning progress on this bot will take significant time.
